		<p>What Is A Digital Wholesale Broker?</p>
		<p>In an age where technology is touching every aspect of our personal and professional lives, algorithms can replace the traditional underwriter model and promote a real-time submission and quoting process.</p> 
			
		<p>Empire Digital’s technology is powered by Appulate™ and provides agents with the fastest and easiest way to rate, quote and bind risks online.</p>
		
		<p>Empire Digital works with leading insurance companies to create this highly automated process which results in speed and responsiveness for our agent partners as well as a higher level of commissions.</p>
		
		<p>While Empire Digital may look more like a tech company than a wholesale brokerage, our DNA is insurance. Empire Insurance has a legacy dating back more than 100 years and is operated by highly credible management with decades of insurance experience.</p>
